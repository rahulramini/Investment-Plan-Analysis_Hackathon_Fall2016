# Investment-Plan-Analysis_Hackathon_Fall2016
This repository contains Investment Plan Analytics.
The Investestment plan Analytics project takes input from the employees about the 401(K) data and shows the analytical table for the 401(K) balance at the end of each year. And we also suggest the investment plan based on the inputs given by the employee or the individual and the risk level.
